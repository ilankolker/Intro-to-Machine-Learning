# House Price Prediction & Polynomial Fitting

This project is part of a hands-on machine learning course at **Hebrew University**. You'll be working on implementing linear regression models and polynomial fitting using real-world datasets. The goal is to explore data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

## Project Overview

### 1. House Price Prediction
Predict house prices using linear regression on a noisy, messy dataset. You will:
- **Build**: Implement a `LinearRegression` class from scratch.
- **Preprocess**: Clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Select and analyze features for better prediction.
- **Train & Test**: Split the dataset, train your model, and evaluate its performance.
- **Visualize**: Plot confidence intervals and explore how the size of the data affects the model.

### 2. Polynomial Fitting
You will apply polynomial fitting to temperature data to model non-linear relationships:
- **Polynomial Regression**: Fit polynomials to daily temperature data.
- **Focus on Israel**: Analyze temperature trends for Israel and find the best polynomial degree.
- **Cross-Country Comparison**: Compare how the model performs on data from different countries.

## Key Features
- **Linear Regression**: Full implementation of linear regression.
- **Feature Evaluation**: Calculate Pearson correlation between features and the target variable.
- **Polynomial Transformation**: Apply polynomial transformations for non-linear data fitting.
- **Data Visualization**: Create plots using Plotly, including confidence intervals and error bars.

## Datasets
- **House Prices**: `house_prices.csv` - A real-world dataset for predicting house prices.
- **Temperature Data**: `city_temperature.csv` - Daily temperatures across multiple cities and countries.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if needed):

    ```

3. **Run the code**:
    - For house price prediction:
      ```bash
      python exercise2/house_price_prediction.py
      ```
    - For polynomial fitting:
      ```bash
      python exercise2/city_temperature_prediction.py
      ```

## Key Concepts
- **Linear Regression**: Model linear relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Polynomial Fitting**: Transform inputs to fit more complex, non-linear patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Decide which features to keep, transform, or remove.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using loss and confidence intervals.

## Visualizations
- **House Price Correlation**: Explore how features relate to house prices.
- **Temperature Trends**: Visualize daily temperature patterns across years.
- **Model Loss**: Evaluate how the model improves as the training set increases.
