🏡 House Price Prediction & 🌡️ Polynomial Fitting
This project is part of a hands-on machine learning course at Hebrew University. You'll dive into implementing linear regression models and polynomial fitting using real-world datasets. Get ready to explore data, build models, and enhance your predictive skills! 🔥

🚀 Project Overview
1. House Price Prediction 🏠
Predicting house prices using linear regression on a noisy, messy dataset. Here's what you'll do:

🔨 Build: Implement the LinearRegression class from scratch.
🧹 Preprocess: Handle missing/invalid data, remove outliers, and prepare the dataset for modeling.
🧠 Feature Engineering: Select key features and explore correlations.
📉 Train & Test: Split the data, train your model, and evaluate it on unseen data.
📊 Visualize: Plot confidence intervals and evaluate how data size affects model performance.
2. Polynomial Fitting 📈
Think linear regression doesn’t fit a problem? Transform your inputs and make it work!

🎓 Polynomial Regression: Fit polynomials to temperature data for cities around the world.
🇮🇱 Focus on Israel: Investigate temperature trends in Israel and find the best polynomial degree for the task.
🌍 Cross-Country Comparison: See how your model performs on data from other countries.
🔑 Key Features
Custom Linear Regression: Full implementation of a linear regression model.
Feature Evaluation: Pearson correlation between features and response variables.
Polynomial Transformation: Apply polynomial fitting to temperature data.
Data Visualization: Use Plotly to visualize results with confidence intervals and error bars.
📂 Datasets
House Prices: house_prices.csv - A real-world dataset for house price prediction.
Temperature Data: city_temperature.csv - Daily temperatures across multiple countries.
